The primary goal is to reduce embodied CO2 in concrete floors as part of the effort to diminish the carbon footprint of the construction industry. A coupled plate-beam finite element model and its computational mesh enable simultaneous topology, shape and sizing optimization of ribbed plate systems. Using analytical sensitivity analysis and gradient-based optimization, we achieve significant weight reductions in the range of 24--57\%, in comparison to reference designs with regular ribbing patterns. The results strengthen the argument in favor of ribbed plates as a structural system that can serve the environmental goals of the construction industry. While our focus is on ribbed concrete plates in buildings, the proposed mesh-based design parameterization is applicable in the general case of optimizing stiffened shells---with potential contributions also to automotive and aerospace applications.

In the context of a case study, the objective of this paper is to contribute to this debate by presenting the first systematic approach to assess the sustainability of a complex biomimetic product. The object of inquiry is a lecture hall's ribbed slab. Based on criteria suggested by the Association of German Engineers (VDI), it has been verified that the slab has been correctly defined as biomimetic. Moreover, a systematic comparative product sustainability assessment has been carefully carried out. For purposes of comparison, estimated static calculations have been performed for conceivable current state-of-the-art lightweight ceiling structures. Alternative options are a hollow article slab and a pre-stressed flat slab. Besides a detailed benefit analysis and a discussion of social effects, their costs have also been compared. A particularly detailed life cycle assessment on the respective environmental impacts has also been performed. Results show that the biomimetic ribbed slab built in the 1960s is able to keep up with the current state-of-the-art lightweight solutions in terms of sustainability. These promising results encourage a systematic search for a broad range of sustainable biomimetic solutions.},

But in America, this wasn't always the case.Though for most of world history, your prospects were tied to where you were born, Americans came up with a revolutionary idea: If you didn't like your lot in life, you could find a better location and reinvent yourself there. Americans moved to new places with unprecedented frequency, and, for two hundred years, that remarkable mobility was the linchpin of American economic and social opportunity. ~In this illuminating debut, Yoni Appelbaum, historian and journalist for The Atlantic, shows us that this idea has been under attack since reformers first developed zoning laws to ghettoize Chinese Americans in nineteenth-century Modesto, California. The century of legal segregation that ensued---from the zoning laws enacted to force Jewish workers back into New York's Lower East Side to the private-sector discrimination and racist public policy that trapped Black families in Flint, Michigan to Jane Jacobs' efforts to protect her vision of the West Village---has raised housing prices, deepened political divides, emboldened bigots, and trapped generations of people in poverty. Appelbaum shows us that these problems have a common explanation: people can't move as readily as they used to. They are, in a word, stuck.Cutting through more than a century of mythmaking, Stuck tells a vivid, surprising story of the people and ideas that caused our economic and social sclerosis and lays out common-sense ways to get Americans moving again.},

These construction works are typically immobile and customised, and must meet many criteria to provide value to modern society: structural safety, durability, serviceability, aesthetics and integration, environmental sustainability and construction efficiency. Accordingly, traditional construction methods, along with the resulting construction works, have been adapted to comply with these multifaceted requirements for more than a century. However, the construction industry has a considerable environmental impact, with reinforced concrete as its primary driver due to its extensive use, and will be facing an ever-increasing responsibility to tackle climate neutrality in the upcoming years. Digital fabrication with concrete is a young yet already broad discipline that brings about the potential for the necessary reduction of the environmental impact and further industrialisation of the construction industry while being compatible with the multifaceted requirements for construction works. Still, it has not penetrated the construction mass market, which is paramount for making a significant difference towards improving the environmental impact of the construction industry. The present study tackles this issue by (i) assessing traditional construction and digital fabrication on a value-driven basis, identifying and summarising their inherent strengths and challenges, and (ii) proposing a value-driven ideation process to identify relevant mass-market levers of digital fabrication in the construction industry. The presented methodology indicates two exemplary applications of how traditional construction and digital fabrication processes can be combined to tackle the persistent environmental sustainability challenges.},

However, following a period of intensive research activity in the 1970s, comparatively little attention has been paid to optimizing the layout of grillages in recent years. In this contribution a new numerical procedure is proposed which takes advantage of the adaptive solution scheme previously developed for truss layout optimization problems, enabling very large scale problems to be solved. A key benefit of the proposed numerical procedure is that it is completely general, and can therefore be applied to problems with arbitrary loading and boundary conditions. Also, unlike some previously proposed procedures, the sizes of individual beams can readily be discerned. To demonstrate its efficacy the numerical procedure is applied to a range of grillage layout design problems, including load dependent problems which could not be solved using traditional methods. It is shown that important phenomena such as ``beam-weaves'' can be faithfully captured and new high-precision numerical benchmark solutions are provided.},

  year = {2024},
  abstract = {For time and cost reasons, reinforced concrete floor systems often employ simple reinforcement layouts. However, this can mean that the amount of reinforcement required is greatly in excess of that needed. Although optimal reinforcement layouts were the subject of research in the 1960s, with researchers identifying alternative layouts that required up to 37 \% less reinforcement, practical methods of constructing these layouts were not available at that time. Given the increasing availability of digital manufacturing techniques, coupled with the need for material efficiency in the light of the climate emergency and the high embodied carbon associated with steel and concrete, it is of interest to now revisit this area. In this paper, grillage layout optimization is used in conjunction with the proven laser-cutting digital manufacturing technique; grillage layout optimization allows the most efficient reinforcement layout to be identified for a slab of given loading, geometry and support conditions. The identified reinforcement can then be detailed in line with code of practice rules, prior to being transformed into a `reinforcing plate' that can be laser-cut from a steel sheet. In the paper, experimental results derived from small-scale tests are presented. These indicate that the load carrying capacities of optimally reinforced slabs are 33 \% higher than those of traditionally reinforced slabs, when all slabs contain the same mass of reinforcement. Issues such as the importance of using `nibs' to achieve adequate concrete-to-steel bond when using laser-cut steel plate as reinforcement are also briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Metal production consumes around 10\% of all global energy, so is a significant driver of climate change and other concerns about sustainability. Demand for metal is rising and forecast to double by 2050 through a combination of growing total demand from developing countries, and ongoing replacement demand in developed economies. Metal production is already extremely efficient, so the major opportunities for emissions abatement in the sector are likely to arise from material efficiency -- using less new metal to meet demand for services. Therefore this paper examines the opportunity to reduce requirements for steel and aluminium by lightweight design. A set of general principles for lightweight design are proposed by way of a simple analytical example, and are then applied to five case study products which cumulatively account for 30\% of global steel product output. It is shown that exploiting lightweight design opportunities for these five products alone could reduce global steel requirements by 5\%, and similar savings in aluminium products could reduce global aluminium requirements by 7\%. If similar savings to those in the design case studies were possible in all steel and aluminium products, total material requirements could be reduced by 25--30\%. However, many of these light-weighting measures are, at present, economically unattractive, and may take many years to implement.},

  author = {Caston, Philip S C},
  abstract = {This year (2024) sees the completion of the new Albula Tunnel under Piz Dschimels (called Giumels in the sources) in the Grisons, Switzerland and is therefore a good opportunity to look back some 120 years at the first Albula tunnel. Construction information and the time line of the original, almost 6 km long, tunnel were published in the Schweizerische Bauzeitung by surveyor-in-charge W. Graf in 1902. One of the many interesting aspects of the tunnel works is how the surveying kept the tunnel builders on the straight and narrow. Graf's article treats us to a glimpse of this in compact form which includes one plate showing the alignments and two photos of some of the surveying equipment used. The surveyors faced similar problems with several longer Swiss tunnels, the Mont Cenis, the Gotthard and the Simplon. A look at the surveying of these and other earlier tunnels also throws light on how the surveyors worked. This paper will attempt to explain how the tunnel portals were located by using triangulation, how the main tunnel axis was set out on site and how the surveyors guided the miners forward. Two teams of miners move along a theoretical common axis towards each other. At the Albula Tunnel one team started from the north-west portal at Preda, the other from the south-east portal at Spinas. The breakthrough took place at 3:30 am on the May 29, 1902. The horizontal displacement of the two halves of the axis was just 50 mm, the vertical just 45 mm. An incredible feat.},

  abstract = {Many researchers have leveraged digital fabrication to reduce the climate impact of high embodied carbon material use. However, horizontal spanning structures (e.g. roofs and floors) remain challenging with respect to energy intensity and structural mass quantity, and existing low-mass construction systems, such as ribbed or waffle slabs, either require proprietary formwork or are particularly labor/cost intensive. Recent advances in mass customization through digital fabrication have enabled efficient, formwork free methods for concrete construction. This work presents a hybrid design methodology using FEA simulation and closed-form approaches that allow for the shape optimization of two-way ribbed spanning systems in response to spatially varied structural demands. We utilize a LSAM (Large Scale Additive Manufacturing) system paired with a nonplanar toolpath optimization workflow to 3D print lost concrete formwork for a cast-in-place, shape optimized waffle slab. The geometric freedom of additive manufacturing allows for the wide range of void sizes specified by the optimization to be printed without significant increase in labor and material costs. With the simulation approaches outlined here and tests printed with an industry partner (TAM) we show a flexible methodology for widely customizable cast-in-place waffle slabs. This novel construction automation approach is promising for a wide range of construction applications, broadening the scope of what can be printed on site.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a numerical study aimed at analysing and quantifying existing correlations between structural masses of the gravity frame in building structures (i.e. excluding lateral load resisting system) and some key basic design variables, such as bay areas of the frame layout, magnitude of floor loads and (main) structural material. Three material options are considered, namely: reinforced concrete, steel and engineered timber. A total of 31,380 different structural frame designs are parametrically generated and analysed to obtain a population of design data points that express the amounts of structural mass per unit of floor area. Least squares and quantile regression analyses have been utilised on the numerically generated sample population to evaluate any existing statistical trend between design variables and mass quantities. The set of regression coefficients so obtained is eventually organised into a tabular format, which allows for immediate estimations of the structural mass quantities (along with their uncertainty ranges) at an early stage of the structural design process. Such a table of coefficients represents the main finding of this work, as it can be straightforwardly combined with existing databases of embodied GHG and energy coefficients, therefore providing an effective estimation tool, for both practitioners and researchers, to quickly assess how both layout and load configurations affect the environmental impacts of their frame design.},

  abstract = {Improved operational energy efficiency has increased the percentage of embodied energy in the total life cycle of building structures. Despite a growing interest in this field, practitioners lack a comprehensive survey of material quantities and embodied carbon in building structures. This thesis answers the key question: "What is the embodied carbon of different structures?" Three primary techniques are used: (1) a review of existing tools and literature; (2) a collaboration with a worldwide network of design firms through conversations with experts and (3) the creation of a growing interactive database containing the material efficiency and embodied carbon of thousands of buildings. The first contribution of this thesis is to define challenges and opportunities in estimating greenhouse gas emissions of structures, expressed in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO{$_2$}e). Two key variables are analyzed: material quantities (kgmaterial/m{$^2$} or kgm/m{$^2$}) and Embodied Carbon Coefficients (ECC, expressed in kgCO2e/kgm). The main challenges consist of creating incentives for sharing data, identifying accurate ECCs and resolving transparency while protecting intellectual ownership. The main opportunities include using Building Information Models to generate data, proposing regional ECCs and outlining a unified carbon assessment method. The second contribution is the development of an interactive online tool, called deQo (database of embodied Quantity outputs), to provide reliable data about the Global Warming Potential of buildings (GWP, measured in kgCO2e/m{$^2$} and obtained by multiplying the two key variables). Given the need for a long-term initiative, a framework is offered to create an interactive, growing online database allowing architects, engineers and researchers to input and compare their projects. The third contribution is the survey of 200 existing buildings obtained through deQo. Two general conclusions result from this survey of building structures: material quantities typically range from 500 to 1500 kg/m{$^2$} and the GWP typically ranges between 200 and 700 kgCO2e/m2. Conclusions from this survey include that healthcare buildings use more materials whereas office buildings have a lower impact. Additionally, specific case studies on stadia, bridges and skyscrapers demonstrate that the design approach can have a significant impact on the embodied carbon of building structures. Ultimately, this thesis enables benchmarking of the environmental impact of building structure},

  abstract = {The production and processing of building materials is responsible for a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, in current building practice, a lot of material is wasted, because load-bearing structures are often grossly overdimensioned. Numerical optimization tools have the potential to reduce the consumption of structural materials, but the lack of customized algorithms prohibits their use in daily design practice. This is because real-life structural optimization problems are complex, involving both discrete and continuous design variables as well as large numbers of building code constraints. In the literature, such problems are usually solved using metaheuristic (often genetic) algorithms, although gradient-based algorithms are better suited for continuous design variables. In this article, a new hybrid gradient-based/metaheuristic algorithm is proposed. It combines gradient-based and metaheuristic methods in a nested approach, exploiting the strengths of both: the ability to handle discrete design variables and fast convergence in terms of continuous design variables. The applicability and usefulness of the new hybrid algorithm is demonstrated in two realistic case studies to minimize the weight of the structure, taking into account all relevant design rules of Eurocode 3. Within identical computing time, the hybrid algorithm obtains significant material savings compared to a conventional genetic algorithm.},

  abstract = {A two-storey 3 bay x 3 bay, 1/12 scale, perspex flat slab model was tested under a one-bay uniformly distributed load, which was applied successively to the various bays. The load was applied using a rubber air bag. The moments induced in the model were measured by electrical resistance type strain gages and the deflections by dial gages. By analysis of the experimental results, and comparing them with the ACI 318-71 Direct Design Method, the following conclusions were obtained: The total static moment given by the ACI 318-71 Direct Design Method is accurate for all practical purposes. The width of the column strip specified by the ACI Code in Clause 13.1.2 of 0.25 \&ell;2 but not greater than 0.25 \&ell;1 results in too great a concentration of negative moment in the column strip. This concentration of moment in the column strip is even less justified for the positive moment where the column strip moment/unit width and the middle strip moments/unit width are of approximately equal magnitude. The effect of the concentration of positive moment in the column strip together with aforementioned restriction of the width of the column strip results in middle strip design positive moments 25\% less than those measured. The provision "13.3.4.6" that a design moment may be adjusted by up to 10\% provided that the total static moment is not less than required should be changed by eliminating the 10\% limit. It is recommended that adjustment be applied to the negative moment only. The provisions for the effects of pattern loading "13.3.6" are insufficient. The limitation of live load to dead load ratios stated in "13.3.1.5" results in a possibility of developing negative moments in or near mid span of interior panels.},

A reference structure composed of central core (made of reinforced concrete) and rigid frames (made of either reinforced concrete or steel) is considered. The reference structure is dimensioned and detailed for buildings from 20 to 70 stories; the embodied energy of each building is then estimated (total, of the components, per net rentable area). The results show that, if some design decisions are dictated by the embodied energy, the premium for height of the embodied energy is not substantial, which proves that tall building structures can be sustainable. However, a structure with the lowest weight does not imply the lowest embodied energy. The results also prove that the embodied energy depends mainly on the flooring system, and that steel consumes more embodied energy than Reinforced Concrete. Ultimately, the embodied energy is confirmed to be a viable tool to design sustainable tall buildings, and the results presented herein may address design toward minimizing the embodied energy, which means to save environmental resources.},

  abstract = {The world's population is projected to grow rapidly in urban areas, with a projected 2.5 billion more urban dwellers by 2050 (UN-DESA, 2019). This urban growth will notably concentrate in Less Economically Developed Countries (LEDCs), where 16 of the top 20 most populous cities are anticipated to be situated by 2100 (Hoornweg \& Pope, 2017). LEDCs face a critical challenge in meeting the demand for affordable housing due to various factors, notably the high material costs, which can make up to 90\% of residential construction expenses (Meikle, 2011). Most multi-story housing in LEDCs relies on reinforced concrete frames with flat slabs. This structurally inefficient system heavily depends on imported cement and steel for many locations. Compounding this issue, in LEDCs, the construction sector contributes significantly to their annual carbon emissions, sometimes doubling the global average and exacerbating the climate crisis (Yokoo et al., 2016). Addressing the pressing need for affordable housing requires alternative, more efficient structural systems that utilize affordable and environmentally conscious materials. This thesis aims to address the challenge of affordable housing by proposing the implementation of unreinforced barrel-vaulted earthen floor systems as an alternative to conventional concrete flat slabs, which are often cost-prohibitive in LEDCs. While existing research predominantly focuses on thin concrete shells for vaulted floors, this study emphasizes earthen vaulted floor systems, utilizing locally available and cost-effective materials. Specifically, it analyzes the maximum spanning capacity of three shallow unreinforced earthen barrel-vaulted floor typologies, examining their associated costs and carbon footprints. Furthermore, the thesis investigates the feasibility of one of these typologies by constructing and evaluating a physical 3m span prototype subjected to international building code loads. The outcomes highlight the structural integrity, cost-effectiveness, and reduced carbon footprint of earthen vaulted floor systems, offering insights into a more environmentally conscious and economically feasible floor system typology for building construction in LEDCs.},

While the isostatic inspiration for the rib patterns of Nervi's floor systems is well-documented, the method used to generate these patterns is considerably unknown by comparison. The methods of experimental stress analysis identified by Nervi and the mathematical theories available prior to the 1949 isostatic floor system patent are discussed to clarify the means used to generate the isostatics. An Isostatic Line Tool developed for this paper is used to evaluate the correlation between the isostatics and Nervi's arrangement of ribs for the Gatti Wool Factory, Palace of Labor, and Large Sports Palace floor systems. This tool can be used by designers in the conceptual design phase to develop ribbed floor systems inspired by Nervi.},

  abstract = {The built environment is one key sector that can be readily targeted for sustainable design intervention as it accounts for approximately 40\% of global CO{$_2$} emissions. Within these emissions, embodied carbon of construction materials is substantial. Two broad strategies to reduce embodied carbon are materials substitution and geometric optimization. This dissertation focuses on the latter, presenting strategies to reduce embodied carbon in floors systems that are generally characterized by inefficiently shaped sections, typically designed with little consideration for carbon impacts, and optimized for conditions that favor western construction economics.  This dissertation addresses these challenges in several ways. The first is by employing structural analysis and design space exploration techniques to rapidly locate feasible concrete slab designs for flat and waffle typologies solutions that outperform code-prescribed rules of thumb with respect to carbon, mass and material cost. Second, this work integrates first-principle structural engineering and building physics knowledge into multi-objective optimization workflows to formalize the study of filler slabs, a lost formwork two-way spanning concrete typology with the potential to reduce both the embodied carbon and energy use of a building. Finally, this work considers context-informed fabrication of waffle and filler slabs, evaluating the tradeoffs between mass customization and manufacturability in waffle and filler slab systems with emerging and scalable digital fabrication techniques for concrete construction. Research outcomes of thesis include generalized knowledge about how to achieve carbon efficiency in two-way spanning floor systems and a demonstration of how computational tools can be leveraged to discover high performing design typologies. Results indicate that with accessible changes in construction practices and utilization of computation, savings as large as 35\% of embodied carbon for a residential building of average span can be achieved with minimal additional capital expenditure and optimally designed typologies.},

  abstract = {Buildings and the construction industry are top contributors to climate change, and structures account for the largest share of the upfront greenhouse gas emissions. While a body of research exists into such emissions, a systematic comparison of multiple building structures in steel, concrete, and timber alternatives is missing. In this article, comparisons are made between mass and whole-life embodied carbon (WLEC) emissions of building superstructures using identical frame configurations in steel, reinforced concrete, and engineered timber frames. These are assessed and compared for 127 different frame configurations, from 2 to 19 stories. Embodied carbon coefficients for each material and life cycle stage are represented by probability density functions to capture the uncertainty inherent in life cycle assessment. Normalized results show clear differences between the masses of the three structural typologies, with the concrete frame approximately five times the mass of the timber frame, and 50\% higher than the steel frame. The WLEC emissions are mainly governed by the upfront emissions (cradle to practical completion), but subsequent emissions are still significant---particularly in the case of timber for which 36\% of emissions, on average, occur post-construction. Results for WLEC are more closely grouped than for masses, with median values for the timber frame, concrete frame, and steel frame of 119, 185, and 228 kgCO2e/m2, respectively. Despite the advantage for timber in this comparison, there is overlap between the results distributions, meaning that close attention to efficient design and procurement is essential.

  abstract = {This paper explores the potential of thin concrete shells as low-carbon alternatives to floor slabs and beams, which typically make up the majority of structural material in multi-storey buildings. A simple and practical system is proposed, featuring pre-cast textile reinforced concrete shells with a network of prestressed steel tension ties. A non-structural fill is included to provide a level top surface. Building on previous experimental and theoretical work, a complete design methodology is presented. This is then used to explore the structural behaviour of the proposed system, refine its design, and evaluate potential carbon savings. Compared to flat slabs of equivalent structural performance, significant embodied carbon reductions (53--58\%) are demonstrated across spans of 6--18~m. Self-weight reductions of 43--53\% are also achieved, which would save additional material in columns and foundations. The simplicity of the proposed structure, and conservatism of the design methodology, indicate that further savings could be made with future refinements. These results show that considerable embodied carbon reductions are possible through innovative structural design, and that thin-shell floors are a practical means of achieving this.},

  abstract = {Mitigating the immense environmental impact of the built environment is an important objective for the architecture, engineering, and construction industries. As initial decisions around layout and configuration have significant effects on the structural efficiency of buildings and are difficult to revise later in the design process, it is essential to provide designers with accurate material quantity and embodied carbon estimates at early design stages. The diversity of architectural expression and complexity of structural calculation has made it challenging to develop a tool that is sufficiently accurate, adaptive, and automated to accomplish this goal. This thesis presents a methodological and an analytical contribution. A novel generative structural design method is proposed, taking low-fidelity inputs, such as those that might be considered during early-stage design, and outputting a high-fidelity structural model that can be analyzed and iterated. The algorithm is tested on 233 structures drawn from wild and synthetic datasets, and a comparative analysis performed between five lateral system typologies. The findings correspond with the literature, verifying the premium for height proposed by Khan as well as Samyn's slenderness premium. The analysis demonstrates the utility of synthetic structural system design for individual building analysis and generates new knowledge about the relative efficiencies of different lateral system typologies at a range of heights. The method evaluates how computational tools, such as design space visualization and topology optimization, may be realistically integrated into generative algorithms. Finally, the rich data produced with generative structural design reveals new ways to visualize, analyze, and understand the ways in which designers' choices affect the ultimate efficiency and environmental impact of built structures.},

  abstract = {Society is building at an unprecedented rate: to house over 200,000 people moving to cities each day building stock will need to double by 2060. Importantly, the embodied carbon of construction due to material extraction, manufacturing, transportation, and demolition accounts for 11\% of global carbon emissions, and this number is only expected to rise. With no end to construction in sight, it is essential that we develop better building practices. The research presented in this paper begins with the critical issue of embodied energy in horizontal structural systems. In high-rise buildings, between 60 and 80\% of the mass and embodied energy of the structure can be found in the floors, suggesting a compelling starting point for materially efficient design. A reduction in a floor system's mass can lead to a similar reduction in the mass of vertical (columns, walls) and lateral systems. This paper focuses on the design of horizontal spanning elements, such as floor beams and slabs, and has two parts. The first part evaluates and compares historic methods of shaped beam design and classical methods of structural optimization. The second part presents a new flexible method of beam shape optimization. These design methods for structural efficiency allow us to build far more with far less, reducing the environmental and economic costs of construction while meeting the demands of a growing population.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel simplified framework for progressive collapse assessment of multi-storey buildings, considering sudden column loss as a design scenario. The proposed framework offers a practical means for assessing structural robustness at various levels of structural idealisation, and importantly it takes the debate on the factors influencing robustness away from the generalities towards the quantifiable. A major feature of the new approach is its ability to accommodate simplified as well as detailed models of the nonlinear structural response, with the additional benefit of allowing incremental assessment over successive levels of structural idealisation. Three main stages are utilised in the proposed assessment framework, including the determination of the nonlinear static response, dynamic assessment using a novel simplified approach, and ductility assessment. The conceptual clarity of the proposed framework sheds considerable light on the adequacy of commonly advocated measures and indicators of structural robustness, culminating in the proposal of a single rational measure of robustness that is applicable to building structures subject to sudden column loss. The companion paper details the application of the new approach to progressive collapse assessment of real steel-framed composite multi-storey buildings, making in the process important conclusions on the inherent robustness of such structures and the adequacy of current design provisions.},

Three elastic design cases are considered to allow investigation of the effect of using different topology optimization problem formulations and different safety factors on the material strengths. Specifically (i) the compliance is minimized under a limit on the material use, and (ii) stress limits are imposed with a Drucker-Prager criteria while the material use is minimized. Imposing stress limits on the design problem considered in this work is found to create solutions that require significant levels of post-processing prior to construction. This heuristic post-processing is demonstrated to have had a significant effect on the behavior of one of the design cases; leading to large variations in the experimental observations. In line with common design engineering practices, the most robust experimental behavior is found in the design with the highest safety factor on the concrete's tensile strength.},

After years of refusing to build sufficient housing, America has a national housing crisis. After years of limiting immigration, we don't have enough workers. Despite decades of being warned about the consequences of climate change, we haven't built anything close to the clean-energy infrastructure we need. Ambitious public projects are finished late and over budget---if they are ever finished at all. The crisis that's clicking into focus now has been building for decades---because we haven't been building enough. Abundance explains that our problems today are not the results of yesteryear's villains. Rather, one generation's solutions have become the next gener\-ation's problems. Rules and regulations designed to solve the problems of the 1970s often prevent urban-density and green-energy projects that would help solve the problems of the 2020s. Laws meant to ensure that government considers the consequences of its actions have made it too difficult for government to act consequentially. In the last few decades, our capacity to see problems has sharpened while our ability to solve them has diminished. Progress requires facing up to the institutions in life that are not working as they need to. It means, for liberals, recognizing when the government is failing. It means, for conservatives, recognizing when the government is needed. In a book exploring how we can move from a liberalism that not only protects and pre\-serves but also builds, Klein and Thompson trace the political, economic, and cultural barriers to progress and propose a path toward a politics of abundance. At a time when movements of scarcity are gaining power in country after country, this is an answer that meets the challenges of the moment while grappling honestly with the fury so many rightfully feel.},

  abstract = {Across North America, the industrialization of steel fabrication in the late 19th century, specifically that of hot-rolled sections, enabled new scales, typologies, and economies of building design and construction. However, steel design during this early period was turbulent, as individual manufacturers provided their own catalogues of available geometries and assumed material strengths, leading to mill-specific schools of design and analysis. During the proceeding century, improvements in manufacturing technology, the merging of dominant fabricators, and advancements in engineering knowledge led to the creation of unified standards of geometry, material strength, and design methodology. In this paper, we follow the progression of steel design, from mill-specific, stress-based analysis to the highly standardized, probabilistic design methodology of the 21st century, and evaluate the impact on nominal strength and material efficiency. With a focus on doubly symmetric flanged sections (I-beams) used for flexural elements, we show the lineage of available geometry as it progressed from wrought iron rails to contemporary steel W-sections. Alongside this geometric progression, we follow the developments in engineering methodology and its impact on the nominal strength beams. Through a computational analysis of over 2000 unique sections produced since 1888, as well as seven design methodologies from 1907 to 2022, we show that both the available distribution of section geometries and the development of engineering knowledge have had significant impacts on the assumed capacities of structural elements and the material efficiency of steel structures since the late 1800s.}

The improved model of milling process as a function of material removal rate and spindle speed has been tested and validated under various cutting parameters. Additionally, the values of the model coefficients are clearly defined, which will be easy to understand and explain each coefficient in the energy consumption model. The model coefficients were obtained using the statistic modelling based on experimental data. Experimental results show that the improved model is able to provide a reliable prediction of energy consumption for given process parameters with an accuracy of more than 96\%. The good agreement between simulations and measured results led to the conclusion that the proposed model can be used effectively for the calculation of the total energy required by a machine tool system for face milling of a part.},

  abstract = {The building sector is responsible for a large portion of the global CO2e emissions. With structural materials accounting for a large part of it, the reduction of material used in buildings offers an important mitigation option to climate change. Standardized structural elements (eg. columns, beams, floors) have very low material efficiencies, as their shape does not consider the final use and load cases. New digital manufacturing technologies emerging in the field of construction and architecture, open new opportunities for the design of mass-customized structural elements, with the potential for more efficient use of materials in ubiquitous constructions. This paper offers a shaping methodology for the optimization of structural elements based on computational geometry and analytical mechanics. The paper implements the methodology for the shape optimization of mass timber beams. The methodology reveals that a large amount of structural material could be saved on standard structural timber elements. The accuracy of the solutions is benchmarked against analytical solutions and Finite Element Analysis (FEM). In order to implement the methodology for the optimization of timber beams, the analytical mechanics of shaped solid wooden beams are expanded from the existing literature and are presented in this paper. With the potential of being applied to a wider range of material systems, the methodology can significantly decrease the material consumption in a wide range of structural elements. Finally, the resulting optimized geometries demonstrate new objectives for the development of digital manufacturing techniques of mass-customized structures for the implementation in standard buildings.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a computational design approach and novel digital fabrication method for an optimized lightweight concrete slab using a 3D-printed formwork. Smart Slab is the first concrete slab fabricated with a 3D-printed formwork. It is a lightweight concrete slab, displaying three-dimensional geometric differentiation on multiple scales.  The optimization of slab systems can have a large impact on buildings: more compact slabs allow for more usable space within the same building volume, refined structural concepts allow for material reduction, and integrated prefabrication can reduce complexity on the construction site. Among the main challenges is that optimized slab geometries are difficult to fabricate in a conventional way because non-standard formworks are very costly. Novel digital fabrication methods such as additive manufacturing of concrete can provide a solution, but until now the material properties and the surface quality only allow for limited applications.  The fabrication approach presented here therefore combines the geometric freedom of 3D binderjet printing of formworks with the structural performance of fiber reinforced concrete. Using 3D printing to fabricate sand formwork for concrete, enables the prefabrication of custom concrete slab elements with complex geometric features with great precision. In addition, space for building systems such as sprinklers and Lighting could be integrated in a compact way. The design of the slab is based on a holistic computational model which allows fast design optimization and adaptation, the integration of the planning of the building systems, and the coordination of the multiple fabrication processes involved with an export of all fabrication data.  This paper describes the context, design drivers, and digital design process behind the Smart Slab, and then discusses the digital fabrication system used to produce it, focusing on the 3D-printed formwork. It shows that 3D printing is already an attractive alternative for custom formwork solutions, especially when strategically combined with other CNC fabrication methods. Note that smart slab is under construction and images of finished elements can be integrated within couple of weeks.},

Optimization results are obtained by methods of stress-ratio, linear programming-cutting plane and usable-feasible gradient directions. A comparison of the efficiency of these methods is given for the grillage designs which are shown to have non-convex stress constraints and numerous relative optima. Instances are given of non-fully stressed global optima and fully stressed designs which are not local optima for cases with only stress constraints.

Making this steel causes carbon dioxide emissions, which climate change experts recommend be reduced by half in the next 37 years. One option to achieve this is to design and build more efficiently, still delivering the same service from buildings but using less steel to do so. To estimate how much steel could be saved from this option, 23 steel-framed building designs are studied, sourced from leading UK engineering firms. The utilization of each beam is found and buildings are analysed to find patterns. The results for over 10\,000 beams show that average utilization is below 50\% of their capacity. The primary reason for this low value is 'rationalization'-providing extra material to reduce labour costs. By designing for minimum material rather than minimum cost, steel use in buildings could be drastically reduced, leading to an equivalent reduction in 'embodied' carbon emissions.},

Referring to most of his important projects, he discusses solutions to various functional and construction requirements where he used precast and cast-in-place concrete, emphasizing the richness of this material. Mr. Nervi stresses the advantages of reinforced concrete, which, he says, allows greater flexibility and makes it easier to satisfy his triple demand of economy, technical correctness, and aesthetic satisfaction.  In predicting the future of architecture he stresses the necessity of architectural solutions that are functionally and technically sound. His final remarks concern his ideas about the proper course of study for architecture students, training that will produce architects with a "far greater technical sense than in the past, a technical sense which results in a constant search for economic efficiency."},

Reinforcement has a significant contribution because of construction rationalisation, resulting in regular cages of steel bars, despite the availability of structural-optimisation algorithms and additive-manufacturing technologies. This paper fuses computational design and digital fabrication, to optimise the reinforcement layout of concrete structures, by designing with constrained layout optimisation of strut-and-tie models where the ties are produced with robotic filament winding. The methodology is presented, implemented in open-source code, and illustrated on beam and plate reinforcement applications. The numerical studies yield a discussion about parameter selection and constraint influence on material and construction efficiency trade-offs. Small-scale physical prototypes up to 50 cm {\texttimes} 50 cm provide a proof-of-concept.},

Such analyses provide the possibility for a more accurate study of the structure than what is possible by using more traditional design tools. However, in order to use the full strength of the finite element method in daily design practice a number of critical issues have to be addressed. These issues are related either to the FE-modeling itself (geometry, support conditions, mesh density, etc.) or to the post processing of the obtained results (stress concentrations, choice of critical sections, distribution widths and so on). The purpose of this report is to address these problems and provide recommendations and guidelines for the practicing engineers.  The recommendations given here are based on what was found in literature combined with engineering judgement and considerations from engineering practice. The recommendations are believed to be conservative, implicating a potential for improvement based on increased knowledge on the response and distribution of shear in concrete slabs and how this is reflected by linear FE analysis. This also means that, in many cases, there may be other alternatives that are equally correct as the ones suggested in this report.},

Aside from estimating sensitivities for parametric NLPs, the program provides approximate NLP solutions for nonlinear model predictive control and state estimation. These are enabled by pre-factored KKT matrices and a fix-relax strategy based on Schur complements. In addition, reduced Hessians are obtained at minimal cost and these are particularly effective to approximate covariance matrices in parameter and state estimation problems. The sIPOPT program is demonstrated on four case studies to illustrate all of these features.},

Parametric design programs such as Grasshopper (GH) for Rhino or Generative Components popularized this approach by providing easy-to-use visual programming environments that integrate with computer-aided design (CAD) packages. A logical next step consists in connecting parametric designs to applications that evaluate non-geometric aspects such as building physics or structural performance. This brings about new opportunities of collaboration between architects and engineers in the early stages of building design. The ease of testing alternatives by tweaking a set of parameters also opens the door for the application of generic optimization algorithms. Karamba is a finite element program geared towards interactive use in the parametric design environment GH. Being a GH plug-in, it seamlessly integrates with the diverse habitat of other third party programs available for GH. These range from building physics applications to genetic optimization engines. In the author's company, Karamba is used in early-stage design, form-finding, and structural optimization. ``White Noise'', a mobile exhibition pavilion for the Salzburg Biennale, serves as a case study that shows how Karamba can be used to optimize the structural performance of intricate building geometries.}

The form-finding process for the global shape of the floors and the generation of structurally optimised print mesh geometries are presented. Three floor prototypes with varying rib geometries and discretisation layouts were studied. The results from the serviceability and ultimate load testing of the floors are documented in detail. The data showed that this relatively weak material can be used, without internal reinforcement, to print a floor that is able to support loads in excess of typical design code levels.},

  abstract = {This thesis explores the benefits and tradeoffs of two significant constructability considerations in structural steel floor framing design. A new constructability strategy combining both standardization and steel availability is proposed, providing a clear, quantitative methodology for constructability integration. This strategy can be easily incorporated into various projects and software implementations to be used in structural engineering design practices. Analysis of this methodology also indicates that structural weight tradeoffs remain fairly insignificant, allowing standardization down to approximately 20-30\% of the initial number of unique sections with less than a 20\% increase in structural weight. Thus, this thesis establishes a new multi-objective approach to steel floor framing design and promotes a better understanding of buildability integration for more efficient and economical structural design solutions.

This paper studies the historical development of Hong Kong's public housing in terms of dwelling size as a measure of housing quality, questioning the effectiveness of standard block and dwelling designs as housing design controls and highlighting the contextual nature of dwelling usability and size. The analysis is based on public housing design projects, policies, and data implemented or presented by the Hong Kong government, particularly the Hong Kong Housing Authority.},

Most critical in this estimation is the structural system, up to two thirds of the whole embodied carbon of a building. Existing benchmarks rely on area normalized carbon content values that do not take the scaling effects of spatial structures -- both horizontally and vertically -- into account. The embodied carbon of a structure can be greatly over- or underestimated based on its effective size, when assessed with square meter averages or typological approaches from existing databases. We introduce an automated workflow that leverages generative structural design for the creation of a structurally-sound building model. Specifically, our method is applicable for large scale steel framing systems that are widely used for commercial developments. With this generative approach, we can accurately and instantly calculate the structural quantities and embodied carbon of a structural framing system without the need for manual input. The method is scalable to urban-level assessment. We show how calibrated simulation results achieve a sub 17\% error margin when compared with real-world buildings.},

  abstract = {A new reinforced concrete beam grillage floor system is proposed as a lightweight alternative to traditional solid flat or waffle slabs used in construction. For the first time, beam grillage optimization has been paired with design code compliant floor plate design, for single and multi-bays of a building. The investigated floor slabs are novel, in that the depths of the grillage T-beams and their reinforcement are tailored for the local strength demands. This engineering efficiency gives rise to significant savings of approximately 40--50\% in the quantities of concrete and steel needed compared to flat slabs. For the multi-bay studies, it was found that moving the location of the supporting columns could further decrease the volume of material required, by over 50\% compared to a standard grid layout. Given the urgent need to reduce the volume of material consumed in construction projects, this appears to challenge traditional floorplate layouts. The research shows that digital optimization tools can be paired with standard design code rules to deliver significantly more sustainable building designs, though these benefits need to be balanced against the construction challenges associated with the more complex geometries that generally result.},
