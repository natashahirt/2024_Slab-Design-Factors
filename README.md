# 2024_Slab Design Factors

This is the code I used to perform my Master's Research. It takes abstract geometric representations for beams supporting a floor slab and, using a novel tributary area evaluation method, performs rapid size optimization and quantification of the amount of concrete (RC) and steel required to support the configuration according to ASCE-17 building code. 

Written as part of MIT Masters of Science in Computer Science + Engineering // Masters of Science in Building Technology thesis 2023; ongoing work.

1. Slab Design Factors: execution scripts
2. Tributary Areas: force distribution
3. Variable Beam Optimization: parallel sizing of steel beams (multivariable problem)
4. AsapToolkit + AsapOptim: custom versions of Keith J. Lee's Asap extension packages that are updated in accordance with changes in the base Asap distribution.
5. Projects: miscellaneous extensions
